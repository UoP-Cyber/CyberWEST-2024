# Evolving world of biometric authentication

# Activity Overview
This session will provider learners with an opportunity to understand how various biometric technologies work. They will get to practically investigate several different biometic modalities, understand what unique characteristics are being used, how they are extracted and subsequently used by machine learning to classify people. In addition to understanding the inner workings of the technologies, learners will also gain an understanding of the limitations and on-going operational issues that surround biometrics.

# Session Duration
50 minutes

# Curriculum Links and Key Concepts


# Activity Setup
<p>The lession requires the following:

<ul>
<li>Presentation slidset - this provides the core knowledge around bioemtric techbnologies and provides the framework for the practical exercise
<li>Biometric software - Face, Fingerprint and Iris - this will need to be run on each of the machines which will have a biometric device connected to it (no installation required) 
<li>Biometric devices - Iris/Face and fingerprint sensors. These will need to be plugged into Windows-based PCs.
<li>Biometric drivers - these drivers are required to enable the biometric devices to operate correctly (may require Admin access to install first time)</li>
</ul>
</p>

# Activity Exercises

Description (x mins)

The practical exercise will be teacher led - students will be given questions and will need to use Autopsy to identify relevant evidence. Over the duration of the session, students will get a clearer idea of the criminal activity and understand where to look for evidence. This will include:
