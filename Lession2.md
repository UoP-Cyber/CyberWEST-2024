# **The Evolving World of Biometric Authentication**

# Activity Overview
This session will provider learners with an opportunity to understand how various biometric technologies work. They will get to practically investigate several different biometic modalities, understand what unique characteristics are being used, how they are extracted and subsequently used by machine learning to classify people. In addition to understanding the inner workings of the technologies, learners will also gain an understanding of the limitations and on-going operational issues that surround biometrics.

# Session Duration
50 minutes

# Curriculum Links and Key Concepts


# Activity Setup
<p>The lession requires the following:

<ul>
<li>Presentation slidset - this provides the core knowledge around bioemtric techbnologies and provides the framework for the practical exercise
<li>Biometric software - Face, Fingerprint and Iris - this will need to be run on each of the machines which will have a biometric device connected to it (no installation required) 
<li>Biometric devices - Iris/Face and fingerprint sensors. These will need to be plugged into Windows-based PCs.
<li>Biometric drivers - these drivers are required to enable the biometric devices to operate correctly (may require Admin access to install first time)</li>
</ul>
</p>

# Activity Exercises

The session will begin with a slideset to introduce user authentication and the increasing important of biometrics. The slideset will breakdown the components of a biometric system and present the ideal characteristics of uniqueness, universality, permanance, collectable, acceptable and circumvention. A brief overview of pattern classification/machine learning is provided to aid understanding (15 mins)

Students working in pairs, they will complete a worksheet that will get them to enroll/verify/identify with facial, iris and fingerprint recognition systems. In doing so, they will rate the biometric characteristics (uniqueness, universality, permanance, collectable, acceptable and circumvention) (25 mins).

Staff led feedback session - from the class, identify the lowest and highest matching scores from the three biometrics and complete the table provided. Amongst the class, discuss attitudes and opinions on the biometric characteristics (10 mins)
