# **Fighting Cybercrime using Digital Forensics**
<br>

# Activity Overview
This activity will provide learners with an opportunity to understand how to undertake a digital forensic investigation. Students will have the opportunity to have hands-on practical experience of an open-source tool and be led through an investigation by the teacher.

# Session Duration
50 minutes

# Activity Setup
<p>The lession requires the following:

<ul>
<li>Presentation slideset - this provides the core knowledge around cybercrime and digital forensics to lead into the practical exercise
<li>Auotpsy for Windows - an open-source computer forensic tool - a copy of this will need to be downloaded and installed on each machine you wish to run the software
<li>Case Image - this is a forenisc image of a computer hard drive and will be the basis for the investigation
</ul>
</p>

# Activity Exercises

The lession will begin with a slideset presentation to introduce the core concepts of digital forensics (15 mins)

The practical exercise will be teacher led - students will be given questions and will need to use Autopsy to identify relevant evidence. Over the duration of the session, students will get a clearer idea of the criminal activity and understand where to look for evidence. This will include:

<ul>
<li>Recycle Bin
<li>Temporary files (CD burning and printer spool)
<li>Data carving
<li>Analysing email
<li>Internet histories
<li>Bookmarking 
</ul>

(30 mins)

Discussion and finishing up the lession - highlighting that there are a range of anti-forensic technologies (such as encryption and steganography) that can really impact a digital investigation! (5 mins)
