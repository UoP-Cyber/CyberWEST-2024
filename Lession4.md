# **Network Attack Detection and Defence**

# Activity Overview

This activity will provide learners with an opportunity to understand the mechanisms behind several Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, as well as mitigation methods. Students will have the opportunity to have hands-on practical experience of a network testbed as part of a emulated network infrastructure and be led through a series of scenarios by the teacher.

# Activity Setup
<p>The lession requires the following:
<ul>
<li>	Presentation slideset - this provides the core knowledge around network and web attacks to lead into the practical exercise. </li>
<li>	VMWare Player â€“ a freely available software for running VMWare virtual machines. </li>
<li>	Eve-ng virtual machine - this is a virtual machine that includes the network infrastructure required for the activity. </li>
</ul>
</p>

# Activity Exercises

<p>
The lesson will begin with a slideset presentation to introduce some examples of network and web denial of service attacks (15 mins)</p>
<p>The practical exercise will be teacher led - students will be running the virtual machine and explore the impact of several types of attacks as well as some of the available mitigation techniques, particularly for DHCP and web denial of service attacks
(30 mins) </p>
<p></p>Discussion and finishing up the lession - highlighting the need for better security mechanisms in a computer network to ensure protection from attackers. (5 mins)
</p>


# Activity Learning Outcomes
<ul>
<li>Understanding the concepts and mechanisms behind some DoS attacks. </li>
<li> Understanding mitigation techniques for protecting against some standard network attacks. </li>
<li> Practical experience of monitoring of networks, detection of attacks, and using protection mechanisms to mitigate or eliminate their impact. </li>
</ul>
